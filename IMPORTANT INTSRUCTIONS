# Intructions For Downloading
Step 1: Download "planaria.zip"
Step 2: Move the folder to your desktop, then right click and select "Extract All".
Step 3: Open the folder, then selectarian"(NOT THE VBS FILE, THE SHORTCUT). Now, drag it from the folder and into your desktop. Skip to step 5 if you don't to follow optional steps.
Step 4:(optional): Select "planarian.ico", then drag it to your desktop. This is optional since it is not required for the program to work, but what it does is it sets the icon for the "Planarian" shortcut. Otherwise it would be a blank icon, but again, this is optional and is just for better looks.
Step 5: Run the "Planarian" shortcut, you should see a message popping up saying "A Planarian has entered your aquarium. Kill it by cutting it in half, or leave it alone." The program has started, enjoy!
NOTE: To end the program go to Task Manager> select "Microsoft Â® Windows Based Script Host"> End task. Another way is to restart, but you do you.
