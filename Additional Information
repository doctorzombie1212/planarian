If you want to modify or create your own versions of this program, you can go ahead. I believe that everyone deserves the rights to make their own custom versions of something else. Have fun with it!
This is not malware. It's just an annoying program with simple VBS files. You can look through the files, and i promise you, there will be nothing malicious. Planaria is meant to annoy, not harm.
