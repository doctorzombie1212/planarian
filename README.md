# planarian
Planarian is a basic set of VBS files created for fun. This program can be considered a nuisance and is not meant to be helpful. It's purpose is to be annoying.
The main reason i made this was because i was bored and it was fun, but i figured that this could be used as a prank program to annoy people.
Planaria itself starts wiht a single message popping up saying "A Planarian has entered your aquarium. Kill it by cutting it in half, or leave it alone." Press OK, and then 2 more messages pop up. It sounds like a reskinned Hydra, so i tried to do a twist.
Instead of clicking OK, and the same message pops up over and over, its a bit more "story-ish". What I mean is that each message for the first few clicks is a unique message and scenario of it's own. You would have to try it out for yourself.
It's named after the Planarian flatworm, a freshwater flatworm that typically is a pest in aquariums and has the stunning ability to regrenate into 2 different flatworms after being cut in half.

Like the real life planaria, the message will become 2 messages when "cut" (aka: pressing OK button). The "A Planarian has entered your aquarium" part is, you guessed it, was said because planaria typically are pests found in aquariums. I thought a annoyimg program that (kind of) acted like a planaria in your "aquarium" (your desktop, duh) would represent planaria being pests in an aquarium.
Also, the requirments to install this is as follows:
1: Must have a Windows OS (preferablly 10 since it was the OS this program was written in, and also some older versions could have different VBS which would make it not work.)
2: Must be able to run VBS
3: That's all!
So, anyways, have fun messing with this short little program i made. Bye!
